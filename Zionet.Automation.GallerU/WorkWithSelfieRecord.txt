At this stage,

to test the selfie image,

you need to hack into the browser's camera,

and we will do it by uploading a video that was taken before,

and then we will upload it in the default place,

and in order to do this, you need several steps:

After the tests,

the browser accepts a video in a format called "Y4M",

you can read about this format on this website https://fileinfo.com/extension/y4m

!!!!

-Now the steps that need to be done first you need to have WSL on your computer or BASH...

-otherwise I used Cygwin:

-After installation you need to go to powershell

-and run as administrator and then run this command 

-"choco install ffmpeg" 

-after it is installed you need to open Cygwin COMMAND

-and go to the location where you have the recording of the selfie

-For example:

If you want to go to Desktop

You can use this command:

"$ cd /cygdrive/c/Users/PC/Desktop".

And after that use this command to convert from MP4 to Y4M:

ffmpeg -i MyFileName.mp4 -pix_fmt yuv420p NewFileName.y4m

Then change the names

And after doing the actions properly,

you can check it by taking the file that ends Y4M and then check if the video works in VLC for example.

And after that you can use a file in your code that uploads a video to a browser
